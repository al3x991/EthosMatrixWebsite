Here are the key elements of our design concept: (I) Wave-Inspired Architecture: The building's facade will feature undulating curves and smooth lines reminiscent of ocean waves. The facade materials will include reflective surfaces and glass panels strategically placed to mimic the play of light on water. This design approach will create a dynamic and captivating exterior, evoking a sense of movement and fluidity. (II) Seamless Indoor-Outdoor Integration: To optimize the connection between the building and its beachfront location, we will prioritize creating a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor spaces. Large sliding glass doors and floor-to-ceiling windows will allow ample natural light to flood the interior while providing breathtaking views of the ocean. Outdoor terraces, balconies to hide AC Units, and a rooftop lounge will provide additional spaces for visitors to relax and enjoy the coastal surroundings.",
